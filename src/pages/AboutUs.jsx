				<h1>About Us</h1>
			</div>
			<p>
				The BHS Art Department offers an extensive program for students
				of varied interests and abilities. We encourage each student to
				realize his/her potential through self-expression in the Visual
				Arts. Additionally, all of our courses are multi-faceted and
				incorporate art appreciation, historical and cultural relevance
				as demonstrated through visual experience. Students may choose
				to pursue a sequential program in Fine Art culminating in AP in
				which students prepare a portfolio of work used for applying to
				colleges, or they may enroll in single courses as an elective.
				Both options help educate the “whole” person and foster creative
				problem solving and higher order thinking skills.
			</p>
			<p>
				Attention Art Students: Each Art course at BHS has requests for
				specific supplies. Please explore the Art Supplies List to see
				what each art student will need for the upcoming school year.
				Contact your teacher if you have questions concerning the
				supplies.
